#  Stingray Document Aligner



![Stingray logo](https://www.maxprograms.com/images/stingray_s.png)

Stingray is an open source document aligner designed to assist professional translators in the production of translation memories from existing translated material.

Translation memories in TMX or TAB delimited format generated by Stingray can be used in most modern CAT (Computer Aided Translation) programs, including [Swordfish](https://www.maxprograms.com/products/swordfish.html).

TAB delimited files created by Stingray can be opened in Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers without special configurations.
